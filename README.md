## Overview of our study
Introductory data science courses have the potential to provide students from diverse backgrounds skills for working with and reasoning about data. However, what predicts success in these courses remains poorly understood. Here we investigate how students’ initial psychological orientation relates to their subsequent engagement and learning. In Study 1, we took an observational approach, analyzing data from 1306 students across 11 institutions using an interactive online textbook. Students’ psychological orientation, (e.g., math anxiety, stress expectations) predicted performance on assessments administered throughout the term. In Study 2, we developed and tested an intervention targeting these aspects of students’ learning experience among 146 students enrolled in a single course. Preliminary analyses suggest that this intervention shifted students’ beliefs about the relationship between stress and learning. Taken together, this work contributes to our understanding of how affective and cognitive processes interact in real-world educational settings.

## Study 1 (observational)
We analyzed data from 1306 students across 11 institutions to investigate how students’ initial psychological orientation relates to their subsequent engagement and learning.

## Study 2 (experimental)

We developed and tested an intervention aspects of students’ learning experience (e.g. mindsets about stress and metacognitive awareness) among 146 students enrolled in a single course.
